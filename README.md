Explore the use of clustering algorithms for image classification. It aims to combine the concepts of unsupervised clustering and supervised image classification, providing insights into how unsupervised methods can complement traditional image classification techniques.

1. Apply clustering algorithms: K-Means, Spectral, and Hierarchical clustering, to group similar images.
2. Use these clustering results to build a system for image classification. By associating class labels with clusters, we can predict the class of an input image.

Inputs: ImageNet dataset 
Outputs: Class labels assigned to each image, indicating the category it belongs to.
